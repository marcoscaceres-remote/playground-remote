          Scope
        </h2>
        <p>
          The Devices and Sensors WG defines client-side APIs that allow web
          applications to make use of widely available device capabilities that
          enable modern, context-aware, and interactive application
          experiences. These capabilities include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            simple device vibration
          </li>
          <li>
            accessing contact information
          </li>
          <li>preventing the screen from turning off
          </li>
          <li>monitoring changes in motion and orientation of the hosting
          device
          </li>
          <li>obtaining and monitoring the location of the hosting device
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          To fulfill its mission and to encourage broader engagement from
          implementers and web developers alike, this WG is committed to
          <strong>security and privacy focused</strong> and <strong>use
          case-driven</strong> specification development.
        </p>
        <p>
          As per the commitment to <strong>secure and
          privacy-preserving</strong> specifications, APIs in scope that expose
          sensitive data will define normative mitigations to address any
          known security and privacy threats. These mitigations are developed
          and reviewed together with the security and privacy community and
          incorporated normatively into the respective specifications. In
          addition, the WG produces non-normative security and privacy
          explainers that describe concrete best practices, design patterns,
          and mitigation strategies that cater to web developers to raise
          awareness.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group will document <strong>use cases and requirements</strong>
          that inform the scope of the technical work to ensure the APIs limit
          their functionality and data exposure to the minimum required to
          implement real-world use cases adhering to the principles of data
          minimization. Applicability of mitigation strategies such as data
          quantization and permissions grants will be assessed on a use-case
          basis considering the requirements derived from real-world use cases.
        </p>
        <p>
          The WG will reuse existing security and privacy-focused web features
          and APIs developed in other groups where applicable. If the existing
          solutions do not provide the level of protection required, the WG
          will explore innovative new security and privacy mechanisms.

          Success Criteria
        </h2>
        <p>
          To advance to <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsPR" title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, each specification must have
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#implementation-experience">two independent implementations</a> of all defined features, at least one
          of which is on a mobile device.
        </p>
        <p>
          Comprehensive test suites will be developed for each specification to
          ensure interoperability, and the group will create interoperability
          reports. The group will also maintain errata as required for the
          continued relevance and usefulness of the specifications it produces.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each specification must contain a section on accessibility that
          describes the benefits and impacts, including ways specification
          features can be used to address them, and recommendations for
          maximising accessibility in implementations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each specification must detail all known security and privacy
          implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.
        </p>
        <p>
          APIs that cannot be demonstrated to be implementable securely within
          the default browser context will not be released.
        </p>
        <p>
          The specifications produced by this WG must mitigate disclosure of
          data when possible and seek meaningful user consent in other cases.
          If the WG decides that one or more of its specifications cannot be
          usefully implemented while simultaneously allowing users to
          meaningfully consent to the use of sensitive data, it should not
          advance those specifications.
        </p>

          <p>
            The Devices and Sensors WG will follow a <a href=
            "https://www.w3.org/2019/02/testing-policy.html">test as you
            commit</a> approach to specification development, for
            specifications in CR or above.

              All normative spec changes are generally expected to have a
              corresponding pull request in <a href=
              "https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt">web-platform-tests</a>,
              either in the form of new tests or modifications to existing
              tests, or must include the rationale for why test updates are not
              required for the proposed update.
            </p>
            <p>
              Typically, both pull requests (spec updates and tests) will be
              merged at the same time. If a pull request for the specification
              is approved but the other needs more work, add the '<a href=
              "https://w3c.github.io/issue-metadata.html" rel="nofollow">needs

              label. Note that a test change that contradicts the specification
              should not be merged before the corresponding specification
              change.
            </p>
            <p>
              If testing is not practical due to web-platform-tests

          To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 6 or more
          active participants for its duration, and to have the participation
          of the industry leaders in fields relevant to the specifications it

        </p>
        <p>
          The Chair(s) and specification Editors are expected to contribute one
          to two days per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum
          requirement for other participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on the input from the group participants, the Chairs may also
          decide to create task forces that allow more focused discussions for
          topics that require specific expertise.
        </p>
        <p>
          This Working Group will also allocate the necessary resources for
          building Test Suites for each specification.

          The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.

          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due
          process, per the <a href=
          "https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus">W3C Process
          Document (section 5.2.1, Consensus)</a>. Typically, an editor or other participant
          makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with
          members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with
          little formal voting being required.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress, but
          consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of
          views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote, and record a
          decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any
          resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face
          meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional. A call for
          consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via
          email and/or web-based survey), with a response period from 5 to 10
          working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group
          consensus on the issue. If no objections are raised on the mailing
          list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be
          considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless
          and until new information becomes available, or unless reopened at
          the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
